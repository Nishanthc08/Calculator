# Calculator

This project is a basic calculator GUI application implemented using the Tkinter library. It allows users to perform arithmetic operations on numbers by clicking on buttons representing digits and mathematical operations. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and parentheses.
Concepts Covered:

    1. GUI Development: Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.
    2. Widgets: Utilizing various Tkinter widgets such as Entry and Button.
    3. Event Handling: Binding events to buttons using the command parameter to call specific methods.
    4. StringVar: Using StringVar to link the Entry widget's value to a variable.
    5. Dynamic UI: Creating buttons dynamically and placing them on the GUI using the place() method.
    6. Arithmetic Operations: Implementing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    7. Error Handling: Handling exceptions using eval() for evaluating arithmetic expressions.
    8. Styling: Setting up the appearance of widgets by configuring their properties such as size, color, and font.

By working on this project, you'll gain practical experience with building GUI applications in Python using Tkinter and reinforce your understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as event handling, string manipulation, and error handling.
